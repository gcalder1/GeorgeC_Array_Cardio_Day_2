    // ## Array Cardio Day 2

    const people = [
      { name: 'Wes', year: 1988 },
      { name: 'Kait', year: 1986 },
      { name: 'Irv', year: 1970 },
      { name: 'Lux', year: 2015 }
    ];

    const comments = [
      { text: 'Love this!', id: 523423 },
      { text: 'Super good', id: 823423 },
      { text: 'You are the best', id: 2039842 },
      { text: 'Ramen is my fav food ever', id: 123523 },
      { text: 'Nice Nice Nice!', id: 542328 }
    ];

    // Some and Every Checks
    // Array.prototype.some() // is at least one person 19 or older?
    // Array.prototype.every() // is everyone 19 or older?

    // const isAdult = people.some(function(person){
    //   const currentYear = (new Date()).getFullYear(); //check the user's date for the full 4-digit year
    //   if (currentYear - person.year >= 19) { //conditional for .some to check age against date wotj greater than or equal to
    //     return true;
    //   }
    // });

    const isAdult = people.some(person => ((new Date()).getFullYear()) - person.year >= 19);
    //the reason this works is because we're still doing the same thing without specifying the current year variable as it's own variable
    //and we are using the function's implicit return since you're still using the function to do your check
    console.log({isAdult});

    const allAdults = people.every(person => ((new Date()).getFullYear()) - person.year >= 19);
    console.log({allAdults});
    //The reason we can re-use the previous function for our .every() method is because
    //the function itself is still iterating and checking for the age of 19. However,
    //because the .every() method returns false is EVERYTHING does not meet the criteria,
    //and stops the iteration at the point where it does not, then we can easily just
    //reskin the variable and use the same function since the function is still looking
    //for 19.


    /*
    +++What does .some() do?+++

    .some() is a method that returns a true or false if the function's condition
    is met. Unlike other methods that alter an array's elements or make a copy, this
    method simply returns a boolean value. As this method iterates through the array
    it is checking, if an element meets the specified criteria from the function,
    then the method stops there and DOES NOT continue through it's iteration of the
    array.

    e.g.
    const randomNumbers = [1, 5, 47, 33, 2, 17, 101];
    
    function checkEven (num){
      if (num % 2 === 0){
        return true;
      }
    }
    
    console.log(randomNumbers.some(checkEven)); //undefined after true because console log is try to give you a result number which there isnt since its just a boolean value

    This does remind me of a do-while loop with a break placed within it because of
    how the break is the "check" for when the loop finds whatever meet the criteria.
    
    This does not handle sparse arrays (arrays that have an empty element) and just
    skips over that empty element.
    
    +++What does .every() do?+++

    Similar to .some() in that it iterates through everything until it finds something
    that meets it's criteria, .every() returns true ONLY if EVERYTHING within the array
    meets the criteria. Throughout it's iteration, if something DOES NOT meet the
    criteria of the function for the .every() method, then the method will return
    a boolean value of false because the iteration will stop, therefore not checking
    anything else from the array. 

    e.g.
    const arrNums = [2, 4, 6, 8, 11];
    console.log(arrNums.every(nums => nums % 2 === 0)); //Remember, you don't need a function name in this case since you're using the function within the console log, therefore you dont need to call it anywhere
    
    .every() also does not handle sparse arrays and will skip blank elements, but
    will see undefined as an element and apply the function to it to check if it
    meets the criteria.
